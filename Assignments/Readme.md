## Assignments

You are required to have all of the work completed in order to actually finish this course.

That said, every assignment will have a due date assigned to it. It is very important that you not be late on any assignment. We realize that things come up and you will struggle with some assignments more than others, but it's very important that you get all of these done as close to their due date as possible.

#### How It Works

For each assignment given, you will have an issue assigned to you. Those issues can be viewed [here](https://github.com/tiy-atl-js-feb-2016/Assignments/issues) at any time. If you click on `Assignee` you will be able to select your own name and see all of the issues that are assigned to you. 

Assignment Status & Labels:

* Open (no label) - Assignment has not been submitted for review
* Open (`Needs Review` label) - Assignment was previously submitted but was not satisfactory (see comment for more info)
* Closed (no label) - Assignment has been submitted and is waiting review
* Closed (`Needs Review` label) - Assignment has been re-submitted and is waiting for further review
* Closed (`Complete` label) - Assignment has been submitted, reviewed and is satisfactory

> Rule of thumb, if it's `open`... you need to worry about it. If it's `closed`, we need to worry about it.
