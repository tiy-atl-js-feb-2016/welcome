## Welcome

Welcome to The Iron Yard! We are super excited to start class on September 21st, 2015 with all of you. We've put together a short list of things you should start reviewing before class on Monday. 

Pay especially close attention to the list of requirements for our install party.

Also, keep in mind that if you get stuck during any of this, don't sweat it. We will be covering all of this in class. This is just a nice way to make you aware of some of the tools we will be diving into.

If you have any questions. Please email me anytime: [jd@theironyard.com](mailto:jd@theironyard.com)

## Your Workstation

Other than your brain, the most important tool you will use is your workstation. Making sure it is properly set up is extremely important. This is the reason we do the install party. Here are some things you'll need to make sure you have.

- Macbook running the latest [OSX](http://www.apple.com/osx/)
- Clean up your machine. Those of you who have not started with a new machine, take some time to clean up your desktop and even your file system if possible.
- Make sure you always have your charging cable with you

## Text Editor

There are many great text editors out there. We would prefer that you use one of the following and we will give you more detail as to why later.

- [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

We will be using Sublime Text 3 in class but either will suffice. Atom is completely free which is why it is an option. Sublime Text 3 is free to use but you need to buy a license after class ends, when you start using it for commercial work. Also, ST3 will nag you to upgrade.

## Terminal

Other than your text editor the program you will spend the most time in is the terminal. We will be using a program called [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/). iTerm is a replacement for the built in Terminal.app. It expands the functionality and gives you a few things that Terminal does not.


## Git & Github

We will utilize version control for all of your work and specifically we will use Git. Don't worry, we'll show you how to get that installed on your machine. For now though, go ahead and sign up for a Github.com account if you don't already have one.


## Install Party & Prework

You can view all of the prework [HERE](https://github.com/tiy-atl-js-feb-2016/Welcome/tree/master/Prework). All of this needs to be complete before our Install Party.

We will be installing lots of things on Sunday, so please make sure to have the following downloaded and installed *BEFORE* you get to our space.

- [OSX](http://www.apple.com/osx/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/downloads.html) (you will want the OS 10.7+ version)
- [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
